## Mastering Concurrency Programming with Java 8
  
Mastering the principles and techniques of multithreaded programming with the Java 8 Concurrency API.

it will cover below topics:

- Concurrency Design Principles
- Managing Lots of Threads – Executors
- Getting the Maximum from Executors
- Getting Data from the Tasks – The Callable and Future Interfaces
- Running Tasks Divided into Phases – The Phaser class
- Optimizing Divide and Conquer Solutions – The Fork/Join Framework
- Processing Massive Datasets with Parallel Streams – The Map and Reduce Model
- Processing Massive Datasets with Parallel Streams – The Map and Collect
- Diving into Concurrent Data Structures and Synchronization Utilities
- Testing and Monitoring Concurrent Applications
- I split above topics into 4 parts:


### Sessions
- Part 1: Concurrency Design Principles and Executors
- Part 2: Tasks and Fork/Join
- Part 3: Parallel Streams
- Part 4: Concurrent Data Structures, Synchronization Utilities, and Testing
- Part 5: Advantage concurrent framework: Disruptor and Akka
